                    <b>How we choose the best online learning platforms</b><br><br>
                    There are plenty of choices in the online learning management software area, so there is sure to be one 
                    well suited for each organization.
                    A major differentiator is price. Some LMS’ are available for free, or have a low 
                    cost entry tier. Others offer more features, but at a higher price point. 
                    <br><br>Pricing models are also different with some providers charging only by each student, 
                    while others having the price based on the plan, and then a lower additional cost for each additional learner. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another feature to look for are the mobile apps. Especially younger learners value these apps so that 
                    a learner can engage in education from anywhere, at any time. Be sure that the apps are available for 
                    both of the mobile platforms- Android and iOS. Also, check the ratings of the apps in their respective 
                    stores, as just because an app is available it may not be a great one with some low rated, glitchy ones out there.
